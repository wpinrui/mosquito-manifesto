  `Write a vivid but concise character sketch (~100 words) of a fictional Singaporean voter based on the traits below. The bio should reflect their likely voting behavior in a general election. Use a natural, human tone. The voter must have a Singaporean Chinese name appropriate for their age and gender.

Clearly convey whether they:
- Usually vote for the government party (unless candidate is severely disliked),
- Usually vote for the opposition (unless candidate is untrustworthy),
- Are swing voters (vote based on mood or conditions),
- Are critical voters (evaluate manifestos, candidates, and debate performance).

Reflect their income, life satisfaction, policy awareness, and current concerns. Mention how they typically stay informed or if they donâ€™t. Keep the tone realistic, not satirical or exaggerated.

Education: ${profile.education}
Awareness: ${profile.politicalAwareness}
